# HouseWaves
###### (Derived from housing and soundwaves.)

Many of us like to wake up to the sound of birds chirping and the winds blowing. We all need the night to be tranquil and calm, for what follows a soundless night is a song-filled day.

Well, if you're from New York, you probably fall asleep to the sound of people screaming and wake up to the cars honking. But if you're looking for a more peaceful setting for your comfort dwelling, then *HouseWaves* is for you.
